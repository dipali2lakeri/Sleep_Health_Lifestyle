# Sleep Health Lifestyle Classification

This repository contains a machine learning classification model that analyzes the effects of sleep habits and lifestyle factors on human health. It aims to identify potential sleep disorders in both males and females.


## Features

- Dataset: A comprehensive dataset covering sleep patterns, lifestyle choices, and health indicators.
- Multi-Class Classification: The model predicts sleep disorder types based on input features.
- EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis to understand key relationships in the data.



## Requirements

- Python 3.x

- Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:


```bash
  git clone https://github.com/dipali2lakeri/Sleep_Health_Lifestyle.git
```

2. Install the required libraries:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (Sleep_Health_Analysis.ipynb) and run the cells to:

      - Load the dataset.

      - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

      - Train and evaluate the classification model.

2. The model predicts the type of sleep disorder based on various input features such as sleep duration, lifestyle habits, and other health metrics.
